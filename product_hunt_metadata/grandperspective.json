  "description": "GrandPerspective is a small utility application that graphically shows the disk usage within a file system. It can help you to manage your disk, as you can easily spot which files and folders take up the most space.\n\nDisk usage is visualised using tree maps. Each file is shown as a rectangle with an area proportional to the file's size. Files in the same folder appear together.",
