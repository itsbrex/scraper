  "description": "ICYMI: 1x launched the NEO Gamma, a new generation of humanoid robots that are designed to help out with things at the home like doing the laundry, cleaning, putting up photos, etc. This is the kind of stuff I used to dream about as a kid but now as an adult I'm not sure if I want a robot walking around my house. Would you let one in and what do you think about home robots? Think they have a future or is it going to be a hype train before fizzling out?",
