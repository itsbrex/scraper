  "description": "I have never used @screamingfrog before but I have been told it can help with keeping track of internal link structure. It's easy to track orphan pages from @SEMrush site audit and ensure each page has at least one internal link.  Specifically, I want to track the number of internal links to a page. If Page A has 2 internal links and Page B has 4, I want a system that visualises so that I can decide which page needs more incoming internal links. Any other tools that can help with this?  Open to suggestions based on any process that works for you.",
