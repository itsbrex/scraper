  "description": "While the Hendo hoverboard is primarily intended to be human-driven, the technology that gives it stability can also be used to drive it via remote control by altering the projected force on the surface underneath it. Right now we use commonly available metals in simple sheets to give the hoverboard \u201cflight\u201d, but we are working on new compounds and new configurations to maximize our technology and minimize costs.",
