  "description": "The product was great a few years ago but hasn't been maintained. The team doesn't care either. I ordered / activated a license before realizing I had already purchased it earlier with a different email. I asked to refund and they offered zero help because of their policy. Seems like horrible business practice to not refund a customer who purchased the same thing twice.  There's a bunch of free alternatives out there.",
