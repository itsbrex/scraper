  "description": "Say you need an errand done, like picking up a package from somewhere and dropping it off somewhere else, sometime this week. This is surprisingly hard to do on TaskRabbit:\n\n1. You can't put up your task and get offers. You must first select a Rabbit and wait for them to reply.\n2. Rabbits have *never* replied to me. The system has told me, 8 times so far, that \"The selected Rabbit is not available, please pick someone else\". Why don't you just broadcast my task and see who's available?\n3. You're forced to pick a time, which I guess is the reason why many Rabbits weren't available. Thing is, I don't care. I just want the task done between Monday and Friday.",
