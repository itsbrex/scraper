  "description": "I love my Faraday Porteur S. I'm a bike commuter and it helps me get around town without being a sweaty mess. I chose these principally because of the design - they're gorgeous. I also like that it's got enough bicycle DNA that I can switch off the power and get proper exercise when I want to, while still feeling like I'm riding an awesome standalone bicycle.",
