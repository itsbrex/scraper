  "description": "Moom makes window management as easy as clicking a mouse button\u2014or using a keyboard shortcut, if you're one of those types of people.\n\nWith Moom, you can easily move and zoom windows to half screen, quarter screen, or fill the screen; set custom sizes and locations, and save layouts of opened windows for one-click positioning. Once you've tried Moom, you'll wonder how you used your Mac without it.",
