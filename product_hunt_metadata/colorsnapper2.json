  "description": "ColorSnapper2's beauty is that it's nearly invisible. It's so lightweight and out of the way that using it feels more like a native macOs feature than it does a 3rd party app. It's an essential tool to designers, artists, photographers, publishers, anyone who ever makes slides/presentations, and beyond.",
