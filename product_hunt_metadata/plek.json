  "description": "Plek is many things to many different people. We like to think of it as a question \u2013 What makes for the best possible playability in a guitar? \u2013 which we have turned into a machine.\nIt is also way of looking at the fingerboard, the frets, the strings, of your instruments. It is the application of decades of research and experience, and dialogue with master guitar builders.\nIt is a philosophy, an idea of quality and playability, as well as a technology.",
