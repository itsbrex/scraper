  "description": "Diffuse is a decentralized music player consisting out of two main parts. One part is the music and the other is your data (eg. playlists), both of which are in locations of your choice. Meaning that there\u2019s no central server for Diffuse, all of the processing happens on your device and all the data is in your control.",
