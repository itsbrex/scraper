  "description": "The Beddit 2 product has a lot of potential but it's been purchased by Apple and since then largely ignored. I think there is a great opportunity for a company like Casper or Leesa to make a competing product and sell it alongside their mattresses but it doesn't seem like something Apple is interested in directly.",
