  "description": "I absolutely love this app for work and in my personal time. As a journalist I can track all flights and see effects of delays, storms, major incidents, air strikes and ash clouds. It is a great tool for fact checking and adding another level to content.In my spare time, I also love tracking the planes flying above me and monitoring air traffic when I, or my friends and family, go on holiday.I highly recommend the app - which can be easily be tailored to your preferences with filters and features.",
