  "description": "The Oasis started off as just an idea. Beau Theriot, the owner of The Oasis, has always been a visionary, but never imagined what his idea would blossom into. Thirty-eight years later, The Oasis has become a well-known jewel nestled in the Austin Hill Country. We are best known as The Sunset Capital of Texas because most days, hundreds of guests from all over the world come to see the breathtaking views and (quite possibly) one of the most spectacular sunsets they will ever lay eyes on.",
