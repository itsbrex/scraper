  "description": "After recording, editing, and publishing an episode, most podcasters are left with one more daunting task: marketing. And while it\u2019s essential for growth, marketing can often feel like a tedious afterthought. Many podcasters simply don\u2019t have the time or resources to consistently create engaging promotional content for each episode. As a result, even high-quality episodes may not get the audience they deserve. Podbooster was built to solve this problem. Happy podcasting!",
