  "description": "Trash app. Tells you that driving towards store for pick up gives you chance at getting gig but also states that if you\u2019re at the store you\u2019re not guaranteed to get it. Makes no sense to waste gas. Pays slave wages. Gives orders to drivers who steal them and are never on time for pick up yet I\u2019m sitting there because didn\u2019t get the gig given to some other unqualified driver. It\u2019s funny. Gives times for pick up and drop off that make no sense especially when the store isn\u2019t open yet",
