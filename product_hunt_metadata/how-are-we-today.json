  "description": "How Are We Today is daily journaling app with a twist. Upon answering the daily prompt, you are shown to anonymous responses to see that we're not so different after all. We're all going through something, but most of us don't like talking about it. HAWT is about connection, not intrusion.\n\nOn top of this, all prompts/responses are automatically translated into 10+ languages for a truly global perspective. Answer in Chinese, read in French. Answer in Swahili, read in Spanish.\u00a0You get it.",
