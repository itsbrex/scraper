  "description": "I cook at home about 3-4 days per week. I've been using Yummly for at least eight years. I first started using Yummly because I wanted to build a digital recipe book. I was looking for quick and easy things to make when I first graduated college. It's helped me do that and push myself to try more complex recipes by providing guided walkthroughs. My favorite feature of Yummly is searching for recipes based on the ingredient I already have in my kitchen. These 'pantry-ready recipes' help me avoid food waste and be more creative about what to cook. The only drawback is that the link to the recipe instructions often takes you to different websites that can be covered in ads, and hard to navigate to the directions.",
