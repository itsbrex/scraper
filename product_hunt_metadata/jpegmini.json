  "description": "The Windows software works well. Sadly, 2 blocking issues:\n\n1) Although they've actually gone to the trouble of building a Linux version, they refuse to sell it to anyone but large enterprises. So if you're a Linux user, you literally have to launch a Windows VM to use the software, despite the fact that they *have* a Linux-native version. Quite weird.\n\n2) On the Windows version, even after you've bought & registered it, it keeps wanting to phone home to check its license over & over. This renders it unusable on an offline PC.\n\nIt's unfortunate because what it does is great & useful, but their strange licensing decisions make it unusable in many scenarios.",
