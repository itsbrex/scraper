  "description": "Miss seeing a working Weather widget in Dashboard on your vintage Mac? I reverse-engineered the original widget and connected it to modern WeatherKit and MapKit. You can patch your widget by downloading my updater apps for 10.4 Tiger or 10.5 Leopard. Try it out and let me know how it works!",
