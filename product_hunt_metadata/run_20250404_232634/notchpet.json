  "description": "There is a pet living near your notch. Does not do anything. But sometimes, can be seen sleeping comfortably. Also frequently takes time to clean and groom itself.\n\n\nThe application is intended to exude cuteness through its mere presence. Its functionality is deliberately kept at a minimum.",
