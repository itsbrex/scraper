  "description": "I'm Arlan. I've been a software engineer for nearly a decade in startups and FAANG. I got my start in Tech right after high school, foregoing a college degree. I was in a situation where most colleges rejected me, and others I could only attend taking on crazy debt. In the end, breaking into tech ended up being my saving grace! So I decided to launch a newsletter giving back everything I learned along my journey.\n\nI would love feedback on what you think I should write about.",
