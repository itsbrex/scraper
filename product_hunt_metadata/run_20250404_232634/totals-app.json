  "description": "Totals is a macOS menubar app that tracks your revenue in real time from Stripe, Paddle, Gumroad, Lemon Squeezy, and Polar. Seeing live revenue updates might seem small, but it\u2019s surprisingly motivating. No dashboards or logins, just your earnings at a glance. It even adds a bit of fun with optional sounds, confetti, and notifications for new revenue.",
