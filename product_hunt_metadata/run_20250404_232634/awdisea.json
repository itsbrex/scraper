  "description": "Awdisea is an AI powered platform that helps YouTubers predict the number of video views they will likely get before even producing a video. It's based on modeling the thought process that goes into creating a video idea. A thumbnail and title alone will give a fair prediction while providing more data about the nature of the video will increase the predictability significantly more. It supports A/B testing of up to 3 thumbnails and 3 titles and tracks the video's performance once its launched.",
