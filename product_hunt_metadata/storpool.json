  "description": "We are very happy with StorPool. Performance is impressive and expansion is as simple as adding an additional node. Storpool allows enterprises to use inexpensive commodity hardware for building expandable converged systems. In our opinion this provides the best building block for cloud environments.As our business grew, the number of servers grew as well. Management and lack of flexibility became a problem. Our initial experiments with building a private cloud were promising, but we needed a shared storage system. In our experience hardware storage solutions are expensive to buy and run, so we started looking into so\u017ftware defined storage solutions.\nWe now have a high-performance shared storage system for our private cloud, which can scale-out when we need more capacity. The downtime virtually disappeared, which led to increase in customer\u2019s satisfaction. Additionally, StorPool\u2019s storage solution is intuitive and easy to operate, which is a significant time saver. \nOur experience with working with StroPool has been nothing, but positive. The product just works and they offer us an outstanding support, that is always available to help.  I would say that this may as well be the best decision you can make for your business. The impact a storage solution can have is amazing. We\u2019ve witnessed an increase in the performance, whilst the downtime simply disappeared. \nSuha Onay\nCEO at D\u0130A Yaz\u0131l\u0131m A.\u015e.",
