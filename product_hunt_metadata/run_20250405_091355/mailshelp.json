  "description": "Hey friends! I'm super excited to share with you a new project I've been working on - Mailshelp, a new tool I am working on to help you and I manage emails.\nAs someone who's always been a bit of a digital nomad, I've had my fair share of email overwhelm. Between juggling multiple projects, clients, and teams, my inbox would often spiral out of control. I'd spend hours each week sifting through messages, trying to keep track of deadlines, and sending follow-ups.\n\nMailshelp exist to solve these.",
