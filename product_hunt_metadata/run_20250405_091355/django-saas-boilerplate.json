  "description": "I noticed that a lot of the features are common across web apps and saases. \n\nRather than starting from scratch every time, I have a boilerplate with basic features that I canan reuse every time I start a new project. \n\nIt uses Django which is super easy to use. It has features like user authentication, Stripe payment, transactional email; and it comes with a modern UI (I use Tailwind and Kutty)\n\nIt saves me a lot of time and effort, I thought I would share it for free :)",
