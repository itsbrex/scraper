  "description": "Cobiro was founded by Bo Krogsgaard and Anders Ibsen who have both spent a huge amount of time managing online marketing and conversions. Spending more than 6 mio USD on AdWords, we have learned a trick or two on how to get the most out of the system. As the business grew, we were no longer capable of managing the entire portfolio of keywords, bidding, and optimization we decided to build an advanced engine with all the learning we have had got since 2004 when we first started to use the service from Google. Google AdWords is a brilliant but complex tool. Very few people we met mastered the system to perfection and that was a problem for our business. We knew the system perfectly well ourselves, but we needed to clone ourselves to keep performing well as it takes a lot of time to constantly be up to date with market conditions, changes in price and many more dimensions. Our philosophy is that Cobiro should be a seamless non-management tool meaning that if our mothers could use the system, it was perfect \u2013 and now they can. Push a button, and it works. The result is fantastic, and we are impressed by how well the Cobiro performs. Once the system was completed, we discussed it with a couple of friends who also managed web shops of various sizes. They all told us they wish they had such a system so we decided to make Cobiro a service that everyone could afford. No cut of spend or high subscription fees. We just wanted to make the service available at a fixed low price. So far Cobiro manages more than 173 million keywords on behalf of more than 3,000 happy online stores. By solving our problem, we have solved the problem for others, and we are humble over how well it has been received. As well as Cobiro is a learning engine we at Cobiro are always eager to learn as well. If you have any input, comments or tips, please drop us a line, and we will discuss it internally.",
