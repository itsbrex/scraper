  "description": "Cognitive biases affect everything we do. Amongst other things, they make us spend impulsively, be overly influenced by what other people think. They change our beliefs, our opinions, and our decisions, and we have no idea it is happening. When we are aware of our biases, it is sometimes possible, to estimate the bias and then modify our behaviour.",
