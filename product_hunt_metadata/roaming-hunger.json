  "description": "After I paid a very large amount of money - 100% up front - I was ignored, passed around, ignored and passed around some more, and finally made to feel that my very valid concerns were no big deal. At several points during this process, I was sure I was being scammed due to the absolute lack of professionalism from the event coordination team.\n\nI had no fewer than five event coordinators, who mostly quit, \"got promoted,\" and never answered my emails and missed our meetings. When I finally had a live conversation with Danielle (thanks to the sales manager sending her Calendly link - Danielle did not) I mentioned these concerns. She told me that I had no reason to be concerned after I would receive the \"run of show\" - but that document honestly does nothing to assure me after months of being jerked around.\n\nThen after Danielle sent me the run of show, another team member reached out to me to have the exact same conversation. He had no notes from Danielle, none of the information that I had given her, absolutely no indication that anything that ought to have been written down, was. Extremely not reassuring!!!\n\nFinally, two days before the event, I was informed that I had been given the wrong menu, and I needed to choose six main options instead of the 3 mains, 3 apps, and dessert I had already chosen. Fine. Sure. On the day of the event, there were only 5 options to choose from.\n\nSo, no. Never again will I work with Roaming Hunger.",
