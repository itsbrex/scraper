  "description": "We couldn't find a simple, clean, beautiful mechanical keyboard that we truly loved. So we created the CODE keyboard. lt's the result of a collaboration between Weyman Kwong of WASD Keyboards, and Jeff \u201cCoding Horror\" Atwood. Two guys that love keyboards. Maybe a little too much.",
