  "description": "A tool for designers to measure screen dimensions\nThis extension measures the dimensions from your mouse pointer up/down and left/right until it hits a border. So if you want to measure distances between elements on a website this is perfect. It doesn't really work with images because there the colors change a lot pixel to pixel.",
