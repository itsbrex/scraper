  "description": "I have been using these for about 1 year.  I worked as an engineer near loud equiment and hated using foam ear plugs because they irrated my inner ear canal.   Earpeace use molded medical silicone with replaceable filters.   I use these for my spin classes, studying, concerts, and any air travel - love the keychain case so I keep them on my backpack.",
