  "description": "The sine function sinx is one of the basic functions encountered in trigonometry (the others being the cosecant, cosine, cotangent, secant, and tangent). Let theta be an angle measured counterclockwise from the x-axis along an arc of the unit circle. Then sintheta is the vertical coordinate of the arc endpoint, as illustrated in the left figure above. The common schoolbook definition of the sine of an angle theta in a right triangle (which is equivalent to the definition just given) is as...",
