  "description": "The proliferation of consumer devices such as iPods, USB sticks, smartphones and other portable devices has increased the risk of data leakage and malicious activity on networks. While most companies have antivirus, firewalls, and email and web content security to protect against external threats, few realize how easy it is for an employee to copy huge amounts of confidential and commercially-sensitive data onto an iPod or USB stick without anybody knowing. There is also a high risk of viruses, malware and illegal software being introduced on the network. A draconian way to prevent this from happening is to lock down all USB ports, but this is neither sustainable nor feasible.",
