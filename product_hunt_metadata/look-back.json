  "description": "I have a years subscription to this software and am beginning to wish I hadn't. It is quite unreliable and I have a number of tests either not record or record no audio. The turnaround time on getting answers when you need help is dismal and very often no solution is found. In theory it is a good idea and a good system, but needs a UX researcher to carry out user testing to identify both technical and usability issues. I am not sure that this happens very often.",
