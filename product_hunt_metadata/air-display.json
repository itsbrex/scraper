  "description": "This once is just like iDisplay in High Sierra. Whatever Apple did with their latest update, it stopped both these apps in their tracks. I just wasted my money on both of them. Duet doesn't work either. It will likely take some time for any of these softwares to update. Until then, I recommend NOT upgrading to High Sierra, or NOT downloading these apps.",
