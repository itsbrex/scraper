  "description": "After over a decade in the basketball realm they STILL are having issues with their most basic of functions. Highlight clips get cut short at the start and finish which is incredibly frustrating when you as a coach put in massive amounts of time to create a highlight reel to scout a team and over half of the clips aren't cut the way you made sure they were. We even started overcompensating and extending the clips so they wouldn't get cut short and hudl STILL cut the clips short. Reached out to customer service and all we got was a bunch of regurgitated, scripted BS. Foreign customer service reps are worthless. We reached out about this issue and was told they were working on it. A month later we reached out again about the same issue and got no response. \nHudl simply doesnt do what they say it does and what you're paying for. At the end of the day they have your money and dont care to follow through on delivering the product they sold you. \nHudl is a JOKE!",
