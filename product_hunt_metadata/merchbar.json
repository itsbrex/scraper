  "description": "First they won't let me cancel at the second day saying that they already shipped (i had 14 days, shipped or not), but they shipped four days after my request. Then the tracking is awful, the reliable ones say the label is still to be made, and \"their\" tracking site only shows a packaged bouncing around and never saying where, and has passed weeks since the last update. Of course, they are refusing refund, always showing me that ghost bouncing and saying that they will refund after 30 working days, that have already passed and when i say it they will ignore and show me again the site (that proves what i say...).",
