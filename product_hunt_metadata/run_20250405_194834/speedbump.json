  "description": "Set a time limit when opening addictive apps. After time's up, get ready to be annoyed out of them with pop-ups, cats, rain, or even the screen time police. Take a 15 minute break before next use.\n\nSpeedBump helps you stop doomscrolling and improve your attention span by making your phone usage more mindful. It introduces intention (do I actually want to scroll social media?) and acountability (30 minutes are 30 minutes -- you can't extend the timer). Download it now to stop wasting time.",
