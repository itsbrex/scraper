  "description": "For over a decade, macOS users have struggled with the Dock randomly jumping between screens, disrupting workflows with no built-in fix. DockLock Lite finally solves this by locking the Dock in place, letting you choose allowed displays, or temporarily unlocking movement with a key. No system hacks - just a clean, App Store-approved solution. Try for free to see it in action, then upgrade for full control and customization. Keep your Dock where it belongs, once and for all.",
