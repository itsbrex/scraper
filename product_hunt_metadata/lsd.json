  "description": "LSD SQL, a DSL for the web, enables developers to connect the internet to your applications as a postgres compatible database. Rather than present a new semantic web ontology or make a new internet, it provides a dynamic declarative language that sits atop the existing one.\n\nDesigned to target browsers instead of an architecture, LSD allows for powerful parallelization while preserving simplicity with just-in-time tables meaning you can just get data without running a CREATE TABLE beforehand.",
