  "description": "I've been using BetterTouchTool for over a decade, and it's undoubtedly the most essential application in my daily workflow. I have dozens of custom finger gestures configured for various tasks, using it to trigger shortcuts in different applications. It provides a much faster way to execute actions compared to memorizing and typing keyboard shortcuts. Without question, BetterTouchTool is one of my most crucial productivity tools - I genuinely wouldn't know how to work efficiently without it.",
