  "description": "Starting out as a Github app, we give you full visibility on your organisation, helping you to manage your team effectively. We categorise code changes into different dev areas (bugs, unit tests, refactoring etc) and we estimate the effort associated with putting together a pull request. Allowing EMs to understand how their engineers spend the majority of their time between planned and unplanned work and improving their ability to cultivate an effective environment for their engineers to work.",
