  "description": "We ordered a collage canvas of our wedding photos & what I received was screwed up beyond belief. They apparently input the wrong measurements b/c our photos were smaller than they should have been & each one had a mirror image, so in the main photo (ON THE FRONT OF THE CANVAS- NOT THE SIDE) my best friend had 2 heads & my mother in law had an extra arm/leg & my brother somehow sprouted a twin. I didn't even know a photo could get this messed up. When I contacted them they wrote back saying that b/c the sides are wrapped it will show a mirror image wrapped around the side, but this was not that. This order just went horribly wrong!!",
