  "description": "I'm sorry to have to give a negative review for CoFounderslab, but I had a terrible experience with this platform. \n\nFirstly, my trial period ended without any warning. I did not receive any notification that my trial period was ending, and as a result, I was charged the monthly subscription fee without my consent.\n\nSecondly, I decided to cancel my subscription after this first bad experience, but I continued to be charged on my credit card. I sent several messages to CoFounderslab's customer service, but never received any response. This situation didn't caused significant financial discomfort but left me with a very poor impression of the service offered by CoFounderslab.\n\nIn conclusion, I DO NOT recommend CoFounderslab to anyone. The customer service is terrible and their billing system is equally bad. I hope this review can help others avoid a similar situation.",
