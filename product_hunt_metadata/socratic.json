  "description": "Socratic is a lifesaver for students who need help with their homework. Whether it\u2019s math, science, history, or literature, this app can find the best online resources to explain any problem. You can ask Socratic a question by voice or camera, and the app will use Google AI to find videos, step-by-step solutions, and expert-created study guides for you. You can also browse through different subjects and topics to learn at your own pace. Socratic is more than just a cheating app; it\u2019s a learning app that helps you understand the concepts behind any problem. I highly recommend Socratic to anyone who wants to improve their grades and learn new things. It\u2019s like having a personal tutor in your pocket!",
