  "description": "If you\u2019ve ever \u2060played 2048\u2060 before, you know it\u2019s a numbers-based puzzle game where you merge tiles to create larger values. But in 2048 Cupcakes, numbers are replaced with delicious cupcakes! Instead of combining twos and fours, you\u2019re matching identical cupcakes to make higher-tier treats. It\u2019s the same strategy-based challenge, but with a sweet and visually appealing twist.",
