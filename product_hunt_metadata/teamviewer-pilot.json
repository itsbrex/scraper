  "description": "TeamViewer Pilot is a remote assistance solution powered by augmented reality that enables you to connect to your support requesters and see what their smartphone camera live streams to your computer or mobile device while allowing you to draw, add text, or tag real-world objects with 3D markers for reference. Even if the camera moves away from the tagged objects, those annotations stick to them, enabling you to collaborate effectively and guide people through troubleshooting, problem-solving, product setup, or maintenance steps efficiently \u2014 as though you were there in person.",
