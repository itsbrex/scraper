  "description": "The most important book you can read on building transformational startups that build and then bring generational technology to the world and live changing returns to teams and investors. This book is focused on wisdom and frameworks for Type A companies and teams, those with extremely large missions and top talent. I love this book and try to reread once a year. As a disclaimer, it's not geared toward iterative entrepreneurs developing linear solutions to problems, and in fact, calls that out in the book, so be warned :) It will undoubtedly leave anyone who picks it up inspired and ready to get to work.",
